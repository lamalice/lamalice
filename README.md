### Hi there ðŸŒ¸ 

I'm currently working on my skill set as an Android Engineer. You'll find various apps where I utilize Kotlin features and building UI layouts. I'm mostly brushing up on basic syntax. 

#### I'm actively utilizing: 
- View Binding for all layouts
- OnClickListeners for buttons
- Intents to send/receive data when navigating between activities
- Different drawables to animate buttons

#### My goal is to:

- understand how to use Kotlin Coroutines
- understand what a Model-view-viewmodel (MVVM) is and implement it
- utilize Jetpack Compose
- utilize RecyclerViews
