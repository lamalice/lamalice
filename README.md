### Hi there ðŸŒ¸ 

I'm currently working on my skill set as an Android Engineer. You'll find various apps where I utilize Kotlin features and building UI layouts. I'm mostly brushing up on basic syntax. My goal is to:

- understand how to use Kotlin Coroutines
- understand what a Model-view-viewmodel (MVVM) is and implement it
- utilize Kotlin Observables / RxJava more
