### Hi there ðŸŒ¸ 

I'm currently working on my skill set as an Android Engineer. You'll find various apps where I utilize Kotlin features and building UI layouts. I'm mostly brushing up on basic syntax. 

#### My goal is to:

- understand how to use Kotlin Coroutines
- understand what a Model-view-viewmodel (MVVM) is and implement it
- utilize Jetpack Compose
- implement ARCore SDK (Augmented Reality SDK powered by Google)

#### Has implemented: 
- ViewBinding for all layouts
- OnClickListeners for buttons
- Intents to send/receive data when navigating between activities
- Different drawables to animate buttons
- The MediaPlayer class to create sound notifications
- RecyclerViews with ViewBinding (more effecient for memory storing & smoother transition scrolling through list views)
- Implement Adapter to RecyclerView with LayoutManager
